📊 Task 06: Basic Sales Data Analysis with SQLite & Python


🧾 Overview
This project demonstrates how to connect Python to a small SQLite database (sales_data.db), run SQL queries to extract sales insights, and visualize the results using matplotlib. It's a beginner-friendly exercise in data analysis using SQL and Python.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python (with libraries: sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib)

SQLite (built into Python — no setup required)

Jupyter Notebook (task_06_DA.ipynb)

📂 Files Included
task_06_DA.ipynb — Main notebook with code and visualizations

sales_data.db — SQLite database containing sample sales data

📌 Key Steps
Connect to SQLite database using sqlite3

Run SQL queries to extract:

Total quantity and revenue by product

Average price per product

Products sold more than 10 units

Load results into pandas for easy manipulation

Print outputs using print() statements

Visualize results with bar charts using matplotlib

📈 Sample Visuals
Bar chart of revenue by product

Bar chart of average price per product

Quantity comparison for high-selling products

▶️ How to Run
Clone this repo:
